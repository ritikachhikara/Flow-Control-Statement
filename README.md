# Flow-Control-Statement
This repository contains examples and questions on if-else statements in Java. The if-else statement is a fundamental flow control structure that allows a program to make decisions based on conditions. It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true, and optionally executes another block if the condition is false. This helps in directing the programâ€™s flow based on different scenarios and is widely used in decision-making processes.
